# Linear_Regression_From_Scratch

The purpose of this project is to learn and impement my own linear regression model.

### What actually is linear regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between an input variable and an output variable using a linear equation (a straight line).

### What is Gradient Descent?

-Gradient Descent is a method used to find the best values of parameters by slowly reducing the error of a model and it keeps updating parameters to make predictions better and better.

- (y - y_hat) the difference is used to find the error.
